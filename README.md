## Overview

P4PP is the control application for a custom 4-point probe measurement setup.

It provides:

- motion and hardware control through serial communication
- measurement execution (single or multi-cycle)
- live result visualization
- automatic CSV reporting

Target metric: **Sheet Resistance (Rs, Ohm/sq)**.

## Quick Start (1 Minute)

1. Download latest release: https://github.com/changhwang/P4PP/releases/latest
2. In release assets, download `P4PP.zip`.
3. Extract to a stable folder (example: `C:\Tools\P4PP`).
4. Open extracted `P4PP` folder and run `P4PP.exe`.
5. In the app, keep the default `R_set = 681 ohm`, then select `MOCK` and validate `Connect -> Home -> Measure`.

Important:

- Keep the extracted `P4PP` folder structure as-is.
- Do not move `P4PP.exe` outside the `P4PP` folder.

## Highlights

- Live GUI for connect/home/move/measure workflow
- `MOCK` mode for validation without hardware
- Real-time status + graph updates
- Auto-save per-measurement CSV reports
- History CSV export
- Explicit controller state handling

## Hardware Bring-Up (Real Device)

Before using real hardware:

1. Flash firmware: `firmware/p4pp_firmware/p4pp_firmware.ino`
2. Confirm COM port in Windows Device Manager.
3. Complete wiring and calibration checks in docs below.

`R_set` guidance:

- Default startup mode is `681 ohm` (`~0.1 mA`), which is the safer general-purpose option for initial bring-up.
- Switch to `68.1 ohm` (`~1 mA`) for lower-resistance samples such as ITO when you need stronger signal.

Read docs in this order:

1. [4PP Master Guide](docs/4pp_master_guide.md)
2. [Analog Wiring Guide](docs/analog_wiring_guide.md)
3. [Movement Implementation Guide](docs/movement_implementation_guide.md)
4. [App Architecture](docs/app_architecture.md)

## First Real Measurement Checklist

1. Pass full `MOCK` workflow first.
2. Switch to real COM port and connect.
3. Run one low-risk test sample.
4. Confirm graph updates and CSV output in `data/`.

## Troubleshooting

### Serial connection fails

- Recheck COM port in Device Manager.
- Ensure no other application is holding the port.
- Re-test with `MOCK` mode first.

### App does not start (`ModuleNotFoundError: tkinter`)

- Use the official release package (`P4PP.zip`) from Releases.
- If you built locally, use Python 3.11 and rebuild with `P4PP.spec`.

### Measured result stays near `0.00`

- Confirm the Arduino firmware is updated together with the PC app.
- `681 ohm` mode is intended for higher-resistance samples; low-resistance films may require `68.1 ohm`.

### Build/runtime metadata error (`PackageNotFoundError: p4pp`)

- Build with `main.py` as entry script.
- Use the provided `P4PP.spec`.

### Build instability on mixed Python environments

- Build using a clean Python 3.11 virtual environment.
- Clear `PYTHONPATH` before packaging to avoid external site-package contamination.
